      "author": "Douglas Adams",
      "ratingStars": 5,
      "reviewText": "A childhood favorite. Cried with laughter. Re-read so much as a child that my anthology fell apart."

      "seriesName": "The Expanse",
      "author": "James S. A. Corey",
      "ratingStars": 5,
      "reviewText": "Not great literature but so entertaining. Like watching a movie. I became caught up with the world and the characters. I enjoyed the \"realistic\" portrayal of a future where humanities problems haven't been solved but rather expanded in scope. The optimistic end turned these novels from a bleak prediction to one of ultimate hope for humanity."

    {
      "seriesName": "The Wheel of Time",
      "author": "Robert Jordan",
      "ratingStars": 5,
      "reviewText": "The series I have loved the most. The epic scape, intricate world building and action. I agree with critics who say that the middle volumes are overly long and drag. However it inspired my imagination, brought me to tears and shouts of triumph. I grew to know, love and hate the characters. I have re-read the full series three times."

      "seriesName": "The Three Body Problem",
      "author": "Liu Cixin",
      "ratingStars": 5,
      "reviewText": "One of my favorite book series. I loved the concept of a deadline to save the earth and how it would impact society over centuries. The interplay between the cultural revolution and the modern day was told brilliantly. Strange and compelling."
    },
    {
      "seriesName": "The Wolf Hall Trilogy",
      "author": "Hilary Mantel",
      "ratingStars": 5,
      "reviewText": "Brought the world of the court and times of Henry VIII to life. I loved the characters and the world that HM built. The characters danced in my mind and their voices sang in my head."

      "seriesName": "The Culture Series",
      "author": "Iain Banks",
      "ratingStars": 4,
      "reviewText": "Loved the world that was built and the optimism for the future. One could argue that these novels are techno-humanist in their message. Though they are more adventure stories. \"The Player of Games\" is by far my favorite novel. Exploring sexual politics, equality and morality. I like the fact that moral equivalence is rejected."

      "seriesName": "The Song of Ice and Fire",
      "author": "George R. R. Martin",
      "ratingStars": 4,

      "seriesName": "The Lacuna",
      "author": "Barbara Kingsolver",

      "author": "Adrian Tchaikovsky",

      "seriesName": "The Witcher",
      "author": "Andrzej Sapkowski",
      "ratingStars": 3,
      "reviewText": "Enjoyable short stories. There is some exploration of themes of love, loss, betrayal and compassion. Not great literature. Good beach/holiday reading."

      "author": "John Ajvide Lindqvist",

    {
      "seriesName": "American Gods",
      "author": "Neil Gaiman",
      "ratingStars": 2,
      "reviewText": "A modern fairytale that I enjoyed. The world building and characterisation was engaging. However I have found that Neil Gaiman's characters are very similar in each novel and his writing of female characters is one dimensional."

      "author": "Frank Herbert",
      "ratingStars": 2,
      "reviewText": "Highly variable. I enjoyed the first three and last two novels but found the writing style overly stylized. There is so much love for Dune that I felt I needed to read it as a Sci-Fi and fantasy fan."
