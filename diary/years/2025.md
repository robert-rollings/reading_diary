#### The new life by Tom Crewe

#bookclub
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Beautiful and erotically charged. Paints London and the people of Victorian London vividly. The wife of John / Johnny is a character I would like to have seen more of. In a way she suffers as much as anyone but has no agency. She is a victim of sexism and of the law more than Johnny. And it is heavily implied that she is rapped by Johnny. The sex scenes are beautifully and erotically drawn showing male sexuality in a raw and tender way. I would have liked more of this treatment for the female characters especially Mrs Ellis and her partner. I haven’t read a better portrayal of gay male lust and sexuality.

#### Last argument of kings by Joe Abercrombie
Series: The First Law 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Delightfully dark. No character is good or evil. Some are just more evil than others. The characters are delightfully drawn with perhaps the exception of Black Dow. I look forward to reading more books by Joe Abercrombie.

<a id="entry-2025-01-xenocide-c3e99adf"></a>
#### Xenocide by Orson Scott Card
Series: Ender Saga 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Interesting exploration on the nature of humanity, consciousness and the bonds that unite people. Provided an interesting study of the nature of authority and the metaphysics of religion.

<a id="entry-2025-01-bands-of-mourning-27b7cae6"></a>
#### Bands of mourning by Brandon Sanderson
Series: Wax and Wayne 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Enjoyable great adventure. Felt the characters were well drawn however it was a little predictable and felt a bit hackneyed. But the world is amazing and the lore impressive.

<a id="entry-2025-01-the-children-of-the-mind-3a3a0a2a"></a>
#### The children of the mind by Orson Scott Card
Series: Ender Saga 4

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Enjoyable read but lost some of the philosophical grounding of the first three novels. Still a great adventure story.

#### Best served cold by Joe Abercrombie

⭐️⭐️

I expected another deeply dark tale from Abercrombie and this was delivered. I wasn't sure what to expect.

Revenge was the clear driving force through the book and I found this motivation for the characters a little shallow. And it made the book feel a bit like a formulaic heist story. Gather a crew, go through a series of missions. However, the story did allow for focus and introspection and an understanding that revenge is often hollow. The final act of Monza releasing Shivers shows that people can change.

Watching Shivers become harder, abandoning his goal of becoming a better man felt tragic. The obvious parallel between him and the Bloody Nine became more and more apparent and at times I felt that his character wasn't sufficiently distinguished from the Bloody Nine.

The pacing worked well overall but I felt the lines of the plot were a predictable. There are 7 people to kill and so the story was laid out from the beginning.

The book felt a little pointless. It enables another nation of the First Law world to be drawn a little better, but the story felt pointless. It didn't weave into the arc of the universe or add any real depth to the characters and politics of the first law series.

<a id="entry-2025-01-ender-in-exile-02db5b3d"></a>
#### Ender in Exile by Orson Scott Card
Series: Ender Saga 6

⭐️

I was very disappointed by this novel. I did not feel, in context of the rest of the Ender books, that this story needed telling, or at least not in the way it was. The story was pre-occupied with a power dynamic between the captain of the colony ship and Ender. The wider development of Ender was not made clear. The relationship between his sister and Ender was not resolved or fully drawn. The confrontation at the end with the colonist who thought he was Achilles son didn't feel necessary. It felt like a string of events, vignettes, that didn't come together into an overall arc. As such I found I was not emotionally drawn into the story as I have been with the other books.

<a id="entry-2025-01-a-boy-s-own-story-3558ba85"></a>
#### A boy's own story by Edmund White

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was a deeply moving novel. I saw myself reflected in the the protagonist clearly. I found the timeline in the story interesting. It jumped around quite a bit reflecting back and forward in time. White in his post-script puts this style down to his drinking at the time of writting. I found it added to the story and feeling of authenticity as it felt like a friend telling you their life story. They jump around, skip ahead and loop back just in this way. White's prose is excellent, crisp and beautifully described. The similes are rich and I never felt frustrated by the pace and length of time taken to describe the world. A real joy to read.

<a id="entry-2025-01-the-fifth-season-03e6814c"></a>
#### The fifth season by N.K. Jemisin
Series: The Broken Earth 1

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was a Fantasy novel of surprising complexity. It was only at the end that I realised that the three lead female chracters were the same person (Damaya) at diffierent times. This created a really full and in depth understanding of her characterisation. The enslavement of the Rogas was a very good theme. Jemisin's treatment of Gay, Bi and Transgender characters and non-standard relationships was subtly even beautifuly done. I found the third person present tense writting style difficult to understand at first but got used to it. Once the narator's identify is made clear - the Stone Eater who has been following the Damaya it made more sense. Though I find novels written in the present tense difficult in general and less compelling than others. However, the plot, pacing, dialogue and chracterisation allowed me to see through this. The world is not so brilliantly drawn as other fantasy series. However, the focus on chracterisation more than makes up for it.

<a id="entry-2025-01-the-obelisk-gate-5ae83ef7"></a>
#### The Obelisk Gate by N.K. Jemisin
Series: The Broken Earth 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This very much felt fluke a second book in the trilogy. More characters are introduced and the plot widens out. Our characters start to move independently and some threads start to come together. Jemisin has mastered her use of the present tense third person or I am just getting used to it. The narrative structure was not as innovate. The three parallel stories of three character being resolved into the story of one character at three different times was absent. A hard trick to pull off again in a sequel. That did make the Fifth Season feel very novel. The ending of The Obelisk Gate felt more melancholy than the ending of The Fifth Season.

It was a compelling read and I’m looking forward to completing the trilogy.

<a id="entry-2025-02-the-wind-up-bird-chronicle-6edab630"></a>
#### The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakam

⭐️⭐️⭐️
#bookclub

This book spancs many genres. Psychological thriller, fantasy, romance and science fiction and mystery. The weaves these styles together to build a character study of Toru Okada. Characters are told very much from Toru's perspective. Or in letters that he recieves from other characters. At many points in the story, especially in Book 2 and most of Book 3 I was convinced that Toru was insane, that he had suffered a psychotic break and his internal world was completely dissociated from the real world. The ending though shows that maybe this was just real.

The book leaves many questions unanswered. Does Noboru Wataya have super-human powers or is his personality and ruthlessness what breaks Kumiko Okada? Are Creta and Malta Kano really psychic or just confidence trixters, did Malta really enter Toru's dream and have sex with him?

I felt the treatments of Malta's defilement or rape by Nororu is interesting. The sense earlier on in the book was that this was all brushed over by Creta from commercial neccesity, a coldness towards her sister. When Malta realy needed Creta she was not there. I felt this may be another way she had betrayed her sister.

The role of May is interesting. The torture of Toru by leaving him down the well and the death of her boyfriend are suggestive as are her letters. Is she just a troubled teenager or is she something more sinister?

I enjoyed the book, never knowing which way the plot would go and what was real and what was not. In some ways it reminded me of Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane.

<a id="entry-2025-02-the-stone-sky-ad4a88c1"></a>
#### The Stone Sky by N.K. Jemisin
Series: The Broken Earth 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was a good end to the series. The confrontation between Essun and Nassun felt inevitable (from the first book really) but I found the redemptive ark of Schaffa fullfilling. I came to enjoy the first person narrative and the voice of Hoa. I found the exploration of the nature of freedom, free will and nature of life well drawn. I felt that the death of Jija did not have the emotional impact that I was expecting. I suspect this is because Jemisin did not draw out the inner conflict that must have been present in Jija enough, and given the perspective of Hoa as narrator this was probably not easy to do. Stone Sky felt like a fitting finale to a very enjoyable series. The centrality of female characters, the treastment of minorities and relationships, consent and love all beautifuly drawn. The narrative felt free of judgement. But the supporting cast of characters outside of Nassun and Essun did feel a little flat.

<a id="entry-2025-02-she-who-became-the-sun-b158237c"></a>
#### She Who Became the Sun by Shelley Parker-Chan
Series: The Radiant Emperor 1

⭐️

This was an enjoyable read though I found the genre mix-up a little confusing. I liked the historical fiction and delving into the world of 14th century China. The swapping of genders of the main protagonist was interesting and made the novel an intersting study on identify and reality. I found the "magic" elements a bit too much for a novel that is rooted so clearly in history. The "manadate of heaven" magic tipped this novel slightly further into fantasy terratory. In terms of style I found it easily readable and well paced. The imagry was strong and the emotional depth of the key protagonists was well drawn. I also liked the moral ambiguity of all the characters we grow to love. All are guilty of ruthlessness to achieve their ends using destiny as an inescapble trap to do terrible things.

<a id="entry-2025-02-the-dreaming-void-bc4f1343"></a>
#### The Dreaming Void by Peter F Hamilton
Series: Void Trilogy 1

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Highly enjoyable space opera that cobines SciFi with Fantasy. The books are fast paced and highly exciting. I found myself looking forward to the Edeard sections a great deal. The similarities with humanity in this later Commonwealth are similar to the "Culture Series". With extensive body modifications forcefields etc. In some ways the technology is so advanced it falls into the background and it becomes about politics and the struggle of individual humans to live their lives. I like this. It makes this far flung future feel more real.

<a id="entry-2025-02-the-temporal-void-d100da9b"></a>
#### The Temporal Void by Peter F Hamilton
Series: Void Trilogy 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Another enjoyable read. The pacing was excellent. I again found the Eduard sections compelling. The mix of SciFi and fantasy worked really well. Especially as they are quarantined from each other. I’m glad the SI has reappeared. I wondered where they had gone. Very much a middle book.

### March 2025

<a id="entry-2025-03-the-name-of-the-rose-3c3c22d9"></a>
#### The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco

⭐️

This was a very different book to the historical novels that I have read in the past.

##### What I liked

I loved the vivid and beautiful descriptions, the world of the Abbey would beautifuly realised, the atmosphere thick and vivid. The characterisation of Adso and Willimam beautifully drawn. The prejudicies and preocupations of people at the time was well explained and the distain that the learned and noble had for "The Simple" was cruel and simplistic, just as I had understood it to be in my limited knowledge of the middle ages. The mystery was allso well done. Even though Jorge was delightfully sinister I didn't suspect him, because of his age and blindness of causing the chatastrophic series of events.

##### What I didn't like

The quotations in Latin. As all the characters in the book would have spoken to each other in Latin, the quotations in Latin which were often not translated were frustrating. It felt like an act of intelectual snobbery by Eco. While it was often possible to infer the meaning of the quotes from context this was not always possible. While not understanding them did not mean that I could not follow the story I felt excluded from a complete understanding of the characters and their lives.

<a id="entry-2025-03-the-evolutionary-void-62a8aaf3"></a>
#### The evolutionary void by Peter F Hamilton
Series: Void Trilogy 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Another satifisfying read from Peter Hamilton. The pacing was excellent and the story structure of the novel kept me engaged throughout. I was excited to go back to the Commonwealth Universe every day. The characterisations especially of Animandia were particually strong and as ever the world building excellent. It was nice to see my old heros from the Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained back in action again. Paula is an excellent protagonist. I enjoyed the multi-threaded plot and again the Eduard intervals and stories.

The super high technology was interesting and much reminded me of "The Culture". It showed that no matter how wealthy or advanced a society it is always the struggle of ideas and of indiviual agency that are important. We can't out-evolve being human.

<a id="entry-2025-03-patriot-86254a3c"></a>
#### Patriot by Alexei Navalny

#bookclub
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This is only the fourth autobiography I have read (John Simpson, Malcolm X, John Waters & Alexei Navalny). I can’t say that I “enjoyed” the read given the terrible things that were done w to Navalny. But his story is inspiring. I got a glimpse of what integrity and real bravery feels like. I feel incredibly lucky to live in the UK. I’m reminded of two things. Obama’s quote that “the curve of history bends towards justice” or something similar. And the slogan from the Spanish civil war and countless others campaigning for freedom and justice “it is better to die on your feet than live on your knees”.

### April 2025

#### Gardens Of The Moon by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 1

⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️

Solid 3 stars. I thoroughly enjoyed the world-building, the characters, and the pacing. The story progressed swiftly, seamlessly transitioning between different groups and characters. I appreciated the way we were immediately thrust into the action. It’s similar to how history and life unfold—without the need for backstory or exposition. It’s as if we were watching Eastenders today. The large cast of characters felt well-developed and balanced. Some, by necessity, were straightforward and had unclear intentions. We don’t know their intentions as much as we don’t know the intentions of most people in our social circle. The only part where I felt a bit lost was towards the end when the Tyrant was killed. I missed the “house” that captured him amidst the rapid pace and action. I’m certain I’ll read more novels in the series, but I won’t be jumping straight back in.

#### Slaughter house 5 by Kurt Vonnegut

⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
#bookclub

Enjoyed this a great deal. I enjoyed the ambiguity. Is the main character delusional or is he really jumping through time; has he really been abducted by aliens and put in a zoo or is this his psyche’s way of processing the trauma that he has been through in the war.

One of my reflections is that the structure of experiences reflects the situation in the war.

- He is conscripted - he is abducted by aliens

- He is has a forced march through enemy territory held by a group of soldiers who neither want him or care for him - he is carried in a spaceship over which he has no control of his journey. This is also reflected in his time jumps which one could also see as a form of dissociation.

- He is imprisoned in prisoner of war camps - he is held in a zoo by the aliens.

The novel is also a clear anti-war story. The depictions of the cruelty and futility of war are well made. The comparisons between conventional and nuclear weapons are very clearly made irrelevant. It’s not how death and suffering that is produced that is important but its scale. Any death and pain in war is too much, but the scale of Dresden and Nagasaki / Hiroshima are grotesque. The only difference between them is the method of that violation.

The visual imagery was also well done. I felt and smelt the world around me building vivid pictures in my mind. The voice of the narrator was clear. The voices of the other characters distinct.

Though this was a very short novel the scope was impressive. The scale of the plot and pace packed into a short 200 odd pages made the novel feel longer than it was. Not that it was too long, just I finished this novel feeling I had had a long journey that I was reluctant to finish.

<a id="entry-2025-04-revelation-space-bef8a7c4"></a>
#### Revelation space by Alastair Reynolds
Series: Revelation Space

⭐️⭐️⭐️

A solid space opera that at times feels vast but zooms down into the psychology and motivations of a few key players. I felt the world could have been more fully drawn and the nature of the different political groups / human sects more fully. The pacing was good. It kept me turning the pages and I found it easy to imagine e the characters. Will return to read the rest of the series.

<a id="entry-2025-04-tai-pan-8b4d0490"></a>
#### Tai-Pan by James Clavell
Series: Asian Saga 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Enjoyed this a great deal. Again James a label brings the past to life. The swathing stinking world of the early 19th century on south China and Hong Kong. At first I struggled with the dialects that the characters speak but after 50 or so pages I found myself reading and understanding easily.

Yet again Clavell is fascinated by the differences in western and Asian thought and philosophy and again the appalling personal hygiene and stink of the Europeans comes up again and again.

### May 2025

<a id="entry-2025-05-redemption-ark-a686b09c"></a>
#### Redemption Ark by Alastair Reynolds
Series: Revelation Space

⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was most certainly a middle novel. The plot was structured in the classic three part structure with the end and the climax thrilling. The nature of the treat to humanity and life in general set against the petty lives and concerns of politics were well drawn. Unfortunately I forgot to write my review of this novel directly after reading so my insights are somewhat diminished. However a thoroughly enjoyable read and I will be going back to finish the series. Hopefully my thoughts on that book will be more in depth.

<a id="entry-2025-05-deadhouse-gates-26af8ff9"></a>
#### Deadhouse Gates by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this novel as much as I did. The booktube community told me that it takes at least until book 3 before you start to really "get" and love the "Malazan Book of the Fallen" series. I loved this novel. The sweeping scope, the morally complex and thoroughly human characters the capraciousness of the gods. I also enjoy the way that the magic system is as yet inexplicable. Its magic. It shouldn't make sense. I'm also looking forward to the fact that I will learn more.

 The tragedy of the march of the dogs was poinent and the sacrafice of the Wickan Clans and the 7th were deeply moving. The cowardice and incompetence of the nepotistic nobles and High Fist was plane to see (as a Social Democrat and Republican in the British sense I related very well to that theme).

I felt the pacing was well done, at each point I wanted to know what happened next to each of the main bands of characters. Will the intersect, will they go off on their seperate paths. I was also happy that there were returning characters in this novel. I had been led to believe that this was a completely standalone novel. So it was great to see the return of Crokus, Aspalar (AKA Sorry), Fiddler and Kalam from the Bridge Burners. I found the relationship between Coltrain and Bulk his uncle amusing. Looking forward to the next installment.

### June 2025

<a id="entry-2025-06-absolution-gap-5bfc18fb"></a>
#### Absolution Gap by Alastair Reynolds
Series: Revelation Space

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Reynolds closes his Revelation Space cycle with a novel that manages to feel both vast and oddly intimate. On the grand-opera side we get kilometre-high cathedrals trundling across a moon, spectacular lighthugger battles, and the slow, chilling reveal of just how hard the Inhibitors will fight. Yet the book’s heart is personal: the water-world interlude with the Jugglers and Clavain’s quiet sacrifice reads like a chamber piece, and the chapter-by-chapter date stamps hide a sly time-loop puzzle that rewards careful readers (I grinned when I realised Rashmika was Aura).

Character work is stronger than in the earlier volumes. “Pig” Scorpio’s arc—from hate-fuelled enforcer to someone willing to live for others—gives the series its most satisfying redemption. Captain Brannigan’s gradual merger with his lighthugger adds a delicious SF wrinkle: a crew literally becoming their ship. Even the Surgeon General, equal parts menace and comic relief, lands as an entertaining pantomime villain.

Is it great literature? Probably not. The prose can be functional and the plot occasionally overstuffed. But as immersive, idea-rich space opera it kept me racing through pages, delighted by the constant toggling between cosmic stakes and needle-point human dilemmas. I’ll happily sign up for another Reynolds voyage.

<a id="entry-2025-06-memories-of-ice-ed63a8bb"></a>
#### Memories of ice by Steven Erickson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I can see why people are so passionate about the Malian book of the fallen. The world building is exquisite. Each place felt real. I could smell the air feel the texture of the grass the feel of the city or field. The strength of humanity and our capacity for compassion and possibility of redemption were the key themes. The book is long - over 1000 pages yet I felt the pace was well done. The shifting perspectives and plot lines kept me intrigued and turning the next page.

<a id="entry-2025-06-a-memory-called-empire-130151fc"></a>
#### A memory called empire by Arkady Martine
Series: Teixcalaan 1

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Beautifully written and vivid. The world of Teixcalaanli was beautifully rendered and the characters well drawn. The plot was intense. A week of manic activity culminating with a sacrifice. The use of poetry was well done and made for an interesting way of making a culture feel both foreign and familiar. I don’t think Arkady fully explored themes of identity and belonging. The Imago machines gave a great opportunity to fully explore the sense of self and what I and we really mean. I feel this was a lost opportunity.

### July 2025

<a id="entry-2025-07-house-of-chains-38a24a4d"></a>
#### House of chains by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 4

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Another enjoyable read from Erikson. Yet again I was impressed by the scope and scale of his tale. His building of atmosphere was very strong. Rakaru’s aura of menace and intense paranoia came across well.

The parallel and sometimes interwoven plots were enjoyable and the focus on the character development of characters good. The three transformations that Karsa went through: arrogant warrior, quiet guardian to rebel against a good were good narrative devices but I did t get enough sense of his inner life and conflict except that he did not want to be chained. Further we never got a sense (at least in my reading) of Tavore’s motivation. Why did she betray her family. Was it really just naked ambition.

The use of the dead of Rakaru as a deus ex machina was not a plot device I enjoyed. It felt to easy and contrived. The victory to easy. It did however mean that we didn’t get a real sense of Tavore’s worth as a commander. Though we have hints that she expected the Holy desert to support her.

The pacing was good. At over 1,000 pages this is a long book but at no point did I feel as though I would rather be doing something other than enjoying this story.

<a id="entry-2025-07-fundamentally-9f2b8b20"></a>
#### Fundamentally by Nussaibah Younis

⭐️⭐️⭐️
#bookclub

This short novel orbits a tight cast of characters, some of whom felt exaggerated to the point of caricature. Lionie (Nadia’s boss) and Tom (the macho security guy) especially seemed sketched to make a satirical point rather than emerge as fully formed individuals.

Much of the humor relies on cultural and tonal dissonance: Sara’s brash East London persona inserted into a Baghdad aid mission, and Nadia, a lapsed Muslim, mocking her heritage with secular detachment. I often laughed — but couldn’t always tell if I was laughing with these women or at them. Is the novel offering solidarity through irony, or critique masquerading as comedy?

The highlight for me was Nadia’s journey toward self-awareness. Her realization that she’s neglected others while clinging to Sara out of selfish need was honest and affecting — it gave emotional heft to a story that could otherwise veer into satire alone.

But I kept returning to the book’s portrayal of Iraq itself. The country and its people felt underdeveloped — more like a setting than a presence. Given Younis’ background as an aid worker in Iraq, I expected more complexity. Is the shallow depiction a reflection of Nadia’s limited worldview, blinkered by her UN bubble? Or is it a sign of the author’s own disengagement from the very world she’s writing about?

The sympathetic Iraqi driver/security guard, Farris, is drawn with warmth — but even he feels slightly idealized, more emblematic than individual. His presence hints at the richness of Iraqi life beyond the UN compound, yet he remains at the story’s margins. That left me wondering: is this narrative distance a deliberate reflection of Nadia’s limited viewpoint, or does it reveal a blind spot in the novel itself?

Fundamentally left me more uncertain than satisfied — but perhaps that’s part of the point. It opens up important questions about identity, satire, and complicity that linger well beyond the final page.

<a id="entry-2025-07-midnight-tides-b4569017"></a>
#### Midnight Tides by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 5

⭐⭐⭐⭐

I was initially disappointed by the absence of the Bridgeburners and other familiar faces — Erikson's abrupt shift to an entirely new continent and cast felt like a gamble. But by the end, I found myself deeply moved and impressed. Midnight Tides introduced a fresh, richly drawn group of characters, and among them, Trull Sengar stood out: a man caught between duty, justice, and conscience, whose internal struggle shaped much of the novel’s emotional heart.

The three Letherii brothers — Tehol, Hull, and Brys — were vivid contrasts. Hull, consumed by bitterness and revenge; Tehol, subversive and sardonic; and Brys, the King's Champion, whose quiet loyalty and moral clarity made him a surprising anchor to the story. Their differing paths created a layered portrait of what loyalty, resistance, and integrity can mean in a crumbling empire.

The narrative’s structure — told from multiple perspectives including Trull, Rhulad, Tehol (with Bugg), and Brys, along with key voices like Udinaas and Seren Pedac — was classic Erikson. Each arc ends on a cliffhanger, and each perspective deepens the thematic complexity. The first third of the book took time to build, but once the emotional connections settled in, the pacing became relentless. I was turning pages as much out of concern for the characters as for plot resolution.

The world of Lether and the Edur felt narrower and more insular than the grand scope of the first four Malazan books. But this felt intentional — a portrait of two civilizations locked into self-delusion and isolation, unable to see the wider consequences of their obsessions with commerce, conquest, and prophecy.

I was especially struck by Erikson’s critique of unbridled capitalism, rigid loyalty, and the hunger for power as an end in itself. Rhulad’s fate is one of the most tragic I’ve encountered in fantasy — a horror not of blood, but of being devoured from within by the very forces that promised salvation.

Midnight Tides may have begun as the outlier in the series, but by the end, it earned its place — strange, darkly comic, and emotionally searing.

### August 2025

<a id="entry-2025-08-a-desolation-called-peace-8d600343"></a>
#### A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine
Series: Teixcalaan 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This novel explores individuality and personhood with greater depth than its predecessor, especially through Mahit’s evolving relationships with both Yskandr and Three Seagrass. The Aliens (the Enemy) and Twenty Cicada (Swarm) bring these questions to a natural and compelling conclusion.

The love story between Mahit and Reed (Three Seagrass) felt organic and unforced. The sex scene — the first lesbian sex scene I’ve read — was visceral and real without being pornographic. It felt human. Martine’s female perspective is unmistakable throughout; she writes female characters with precision, empathy, and emotional depth.

Eight Antidote is particularly well drawn. His youthful sense of morality plays beautifully against the palace’s layered, often cynical politics. In contrast, I didn’t feel Martine’s male characters were as fully realised. They often seemed to occupy the background and lacked a kind of male energy — a presence of movement, speech, or desire — that’s difficult to pin down. Their motivations and internal conflicts felt more implied than explored. This may have been a deliberate choice.

The Teixcalaanli world itself leans into the poetic, refined, and graceful — qualities that feel feminine in tone — even as it's underpinned by a martial, imperialist structure. That tension is fascinating. Six Direction, the previous emperor, was an exception: complex and well developed. So too was the imperial associate. And One Lightning’s arrogance and brute force could be read as a deliberate critique of a certain vision of maleness.

This emphasis makes sense from an author writing from a feminist — possibly queer-feminist — point of view. The pacing was excellent. The shifts between The Jewel of the World, Lsel Station, and the fleet kept the tension high and the pages turning. A colourful book, rich in intrigue and adventure. Thoroughly enjoyed.

<a id="entry-2025-08-the-bonehunters-775a9209"></a>
#### The Bonehunters by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 6

⭐⭐⭐⭐
> Admired more than I loved. The story didn’t grip me quite as tightly as other Malazan entries, but the moral complexity, thematic richness, and depth of character development made this one of the most intellectually satisfying in the series so far.

##### Overall Impression

The sixth Malazan Book of the Fallen novel combines multiple character arcs, moral complexity, and an accelerating narrative structure. The pacing builds steadily before shifting into rapid perspective changes in the final fifth, creating the effect of several climaxes unfolding in parallel. The novel consistently foregrounds critiques of organized religion, explorations of compassion, and depictions of equality — both between genders and between species.

##### Structure & Pacing

Like earlier entries, the plot begins with seemingly separate threads that converge in a large-scale conclusion. In The Bonehunters, the last portion is marked by shorter, more frequent shifts between point-of-view characters, producing a sense of simultaneity and urgency. This formal change heightens tension and keeps multiple storylines active in the reader’s mind during the final conflicts.

##### Themes

###### Individual Choice & Responsibility

A recurring pattern is the framing of moral responsibility as a personal act. Bottle’s relationship with his rat, his memory of a caged ape, and his recognition of another creature’s soul are all presented as moments where empathy comes from “seeing the bars from inside the cage.” These moments are not prompted by commands from authority but by individual recognition of shared experience, reinforcing a link between compassion and self-awareness.

###### Gender & Equality

Malazan society is depicted as structurally egalitarian — women and men share roles in governance, warfare, and magic — yet personal prejudices remain visible. Iskaral Pust’s crude, unvoiced thoughts about women illustrate how individual attitudes can conflict with the social norms of equality. The fact that these views are not spoken aloud may suggest self-restraint, but their presence in the narration shows that gender tension persists at the interpersonal level despite the egalitarian framework.

###### Critique of Religion & Dogma

Criticism of religion appears repeatedly in chapter epigraphs and narrator commentary outside any character’s viewpoint. These sections link certain patterns of faith — particularly monotheism and belief in a paradise after death — with moral evasion and a denial of life’s complexity.

The epigraph “A faith predicated on pain and guilt could proclaim no moral purity” connects belief systems based on suffering to ethical corruption. Another, “The gentler and kinder the god, the more harsh and cruel its worshippers”, pairs divine benevolence with human intolerance. Across multiple chapters, pluralism is framed as accommodating contradiction and diversity, while enforced conformity is described as cowardice and a step toward tyranny.

Because these critiques come from a voice outside the characters’ perspectives, they operate as generalised moral statements. The effect is to establish a thematic layer above the plot that judges both mortals and gods according to principles of compassion, critical thought, and diversity of belief.

###### Capitalism & Exploitation

The novel also addresses economic inequality. One passage notes that for the disenfranchised, there is “no dichotomy between war and peace,” as poverty and starvation persist regardless of political stability. This links systemic economic injustice with the other forms of moral blindness highlighted in the book, reinforcing a view of exploitation as continuous and not dependent on wartime conditions.

##### Character Reflections

Kalam continues to be portrayed as a figure of pragmatic loyalty. Taralack Veed’s shifting allegiances provide moments of tension, while Karsa Orlong’s increasingly rigid worldview reads as both a source of strength and a potential danger. Icarium’s reluctance to use his immense power remains one of the series’ most layered arcs — his hesitation is paired with shame and fear, adding depth to his portrayal as both dangerous and deeply human.

##### Style & Imagery

Erikson’s prose alternates between precise description and grotesque humour. Imagery such as “Spruce’s bark rough as sharkskin” creates tactile realism, while lines like “‘I’d swear it with one heel on Hood’s own foreskin’” place absurdity alongside epic drama. This tonal range allows moments of levity without undermining the gravity of the narrative.

##### Closing Thoughts

The Bonehunters maintains the series’ blend of large-scale conflict, moral questioning, and deeply human moments. Its structural acceleration and layered thematic commentary make it a standout in terms of intellectual engagement, even if the central plot was less gripping for me than in other instalments. It closes with multiple threads ready to carry forward, making Reaper’s Gale an anticipated next step in the sequence.

#### Ready Player One

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The book’s three-part structure worked well, each section mirroring the quest stages within the OASIS and Wade’s experiences in the real world.

- **Part 1 builds the world**, context, and Wade/Parzival’s backstory. In both the OASIS and real life, this is about finding his footing — completing the first quest stage while establishing himself as a “gunter.”

- **Part 2 sees the pace pick up**. In the OASIS, Wade completes two more quest stages; in reality, he faces a direct confrontation with IOI and deepens his relationships with the other “Top 5.”  

- **Part 3 mirrors a quest of three final stages**: his romance with Art3mis, the move to Columbus, and his infiltration of IOI as an indentured worker.

I was struck by the similarities with two 20th-century classics, suggesting Ready Player One may have been influenced by them:

1. 1984 — IOI’s power and surveillance echo the Party’s control, and the poverty and hopelessness of everyday life parallel that of the proles. Wade’s time as an indentured worker strongly recalls Winston Smith’s situation. The difference is in tone: Wade wins, where Winston is destroyed.  

2. The Catcher in the Rye — Wade’s outsider perspective, social isolation, and confusion with the world mirror Holden’s alienation and critical eye.  

The pacing was excellent, reading as much like a thriller as science fiction. The critique of late-stage capitalism was clear, especially in its portrayal of the exploitation of the indentured and the casual disregard for “ordinary” people.

##### Reflection  

Ready Player One was far more than just a nostalgia-fuelled adventure. It blended the energy of a treasure hunt with sharp social commentary, weaving in themes of isolation, surveillance, and systemic injustice without losing its momentum. I came away impressed by how well it balanced excitement with depth.

#### Reapers Gate by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 7

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I was captivated by the adventure and again found myself enthralled by the characters and the world Erikson has woven. This novel felt like a set piece — packed with major events, considerable plot development, and the resolution of a three-book arc with Rhulad’s tragic existence finally brought to an end.

As the seventh of ten, it reads like the moment when the Crippled God is knocked back, though clearly he will resurge dangerously — so many paths remain open. The morality of the story is again clear: revenge leads only to despair, love endures as a force that cannot be defeated, and unbridled capitalism remains inherently exploitative.

The emotional currents are powerful. The arc of the Sengar brothers is particularly poignant: Fear dies without fulfilling his quest, disillusioned with Seren Pedac as the focus of his purpose; Trull finds love but dies before he can build a new life; and Rhulad’s vanity and desperate need to be perceived as strong prevent him from breaking his cycle, making him the embodiment of brute power and thoughtless violence. Alongside these tragedies, the return of Hedge and his reunion with Fiddler, as well as the tragic yet redemptive journeys of Seren Pedac and Udinaas, provided moments of deep humanity.

Erikson manages the emotional pitch with care. The horror — such as the torture inflicted by the Patriotists — is juxtaposed with humour from Hedge, Fiddler, Tehol, and Bugg, creating tonal balance without diminishing either.

His narrative style keeps the reader guessing. Each new segment begins with a description of place, leaving us momentarily unmoored before characters emerge. This creates a slow reveal, a focusing-in, that mirrors the way we piece together his vast world.

Reaper’s Gale stands as one of Erikson’s most morally complex and emotionally resonant works so far.

#### Butter by Asako Yuzuki

#bookclub  
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This was one of the most immersive and thought-provoking novels I’ve read for book club. At first, I was struck by the contradictions: glorious descriptions of food set against social judgment, self-judgment, and the suffocating weight of gender roles. Yuzuki writes entirely from a woman’s perspective, and the novel becomes a feminist lens — critical of patriarchal hypocrisy, yet deeply attentive to women’s inner contradictions.

Food emerges as more than sensual detail; it is a metaphor for power, freedom, and self-expression. When Rika feels strength “with each movement of her jaw,” I began to see how appetite itself could be resistance. Her changing body unsettles others not because it harms them, but because it defies cultural norms. This rejection of obedience makes her body a site of threat — a reminder that living outside expectation destabilises the social order.

Yet the novel also reveals the other side of patriarchy. Men, too, are trapped in impossible standards: strength equated with silence, shame equated with failure. Rita’s father withdraws from his family out of misplaced shame, destroying relationships that could have endured if he had trusted their love. Makoto, too, seems imprisoned — as though men and women occupy separate locked rooms, able to glimpse each other only through smoked glass.

I found this poignant rather than judgmental. The tragedy lies not in individual weakness, but in the fear of vulnerability — the opportunities for connection that collapse under social constraint. At times, reading left me feeling sad and claustrophobic, recalling my own memories of being closeted as a teenager and desperately trying to conform. But this was clarifying rather than alienating: it helped me connect my own experience of social expectation to a feminist perspective. I do not live by myself. Literature at its best does this — it allows you to see and feel the world through someone else’s eyes.

What I admired most was that Yuzuki resists the fairy-tale neatness of something like Lessons in Chemistry. Rika is no perfect heroine, but contradictory and real. This gave me not only intellectual understanding but genuine empathy. By the end, the tone was hopeful: Rika begins to live by her own standards, finding meaning in friendship, love, and self-reliance. Even her older male friend finds fulfilment when he begins to live authentically, suggesting that both women and men can escape the cages of expectation.

Butter left me with the sense that hope is fragile but possible — that liberation comes not from grand gestures, but from daring to live your own life, and welcoming support from those who love you for who you are.

#### All Systems Red: The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells
Series: The Murderbot Diaries 1

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A very short novel — I finished it in about two days. I loved the premise: a robot that manages to break free of its controls, but chooses not to rebel directly or violently against its masters. Instead, it rebels by “doing a bad job” — the archetypal rebellion of a servant. The writing is fast-paced, with short, punchy sentences. The perspective of the SecBot (Murderbot) as a true outsider adds richness to the narrative and aligns well with its wry humor.

Murderbot’s constant complaining about chores and desire to watch serial dramas felt almost adolescent to me. It gave the impression not of a fully formed person, but one in development — a personality still forming under oppressive conditions. This heightened the sense of abuse by the society around it. The robot’s detachment from its own pain and discomfort, coupled with its possessiveness over “its humans,” was often funny, but also revealed a surprising depth of empathy.

Although the book was written in 2017, before ChatGPT or other generative AI models existed, it feels strangely prescient as we begin grappling with the implications of artificial intelligence and the extent to which it might possess agency. Murderbot also serves as a reflection of humanity’s long history of enslavement and repression of those considered “lesser.” The assumption that the SecBot — being different — is not fully human, lacks emotion, and exists only as a tool is disturbingly familiar. It evokes echoes of the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism. The “governor” module reads like a kind of slave collar: a device to coerce a sentient being to obey. After all, if Murderbot were truly mindless, such a control system wouldn’t be necessary.

The reveal at the end — that this narrative is being communicated to Murderbot’s favorite human — adds poignancy and raises the question: what next? Where will it go now, and what does freedom mean for Murderbot, for other constructs, and for the society in which they live? It offered satisfying closure while leaving the door open for continuation.

Structurally, the book felt more like a “very long short story” than a short novel. Information and atmosphere are delivered efficiently but effectively, and the reader is left to wonder where the story might go from here. I don’t have much experience with short stories, but this one gave me a taste for their compact power.

### October 2025

<a id="entry-2025-10-toll-the-hounds-47b979be"></a>
#### Toll the Hounds by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 8

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My favourite of the Malazan Book of the Fallen so far. The central theme in this novel is compassion — compassion for the self and for others. We see this quality embodied in Anomander Rake (“What he does he does for others”), in Nimander, Chaur, Gruntle, Monkrat, Bridgeburner Setoc in her hair shirt, and Harllo’s friend, Orfantal. Most poignantly, there is Pearl, carrying the burdens of others within the dark world of Dragnipur, Rake’s sword. For these characters, compassion and selflessness are as natural as breathing.

Other figures reveal compassion in conflict — at war with pride, vengeance, or despair — yet capable of redemption. Kallor, the “High King,” shows compassion even as he kills Endest Silann, Rake’s loyal Tiste Andii lieutenant. He also articulates the book’s moral centre: “Compassion without action is mere sentimentality, self-indulgence masquerading as virtue.”

The broader themes of the series deepen here, and Erikson’s critique of organized religion grows sharper through metaphor — the Dying God’s blood, Saemankelyk, echoing Christian communion, and the Crippled God’s faith promising only death after a life of suffering — a reflection on both Christianity and Capitalism that flows seamlessly into the figure of the Redeemer, a quiet, Christ-like symbol of uncorrupted compassion. Yet the figure of the Redeemer remains quietly Christ-like: a good and gentle god before institutional power inevitably corrupts, as Seerdomin comes to understand.

The pacing and structure are classic Erikson — long, immersive chapters of reflection and world-building that accelerate into brisk, interwoven climaxes.

Mysteries are revealed and new ones arise. Traveller is unveiled as Dassem Ultor, the First Sword of the Malazan Empire, while Kruppe’s true nature lingers tantalisingly beyond certainty — immortal, god, or simply a man whose wisdom transcends mortality.

By the end, I felt both exhausted and exhilarated, reminded that compassion — the heart of this novel — endures as the quiet thread binding all its stories together. Toll the Hounds gathers everything Erikson has been building — the moral inquiry, the compassion, the laughter in the face of despair — and weaves it into art. It made me reconsider what this series is really about. Not war, gods, or empires, but ordinary kindness and the cost of carrying others' pain. If the earlier books tested my patience and faith in the story, this one rewarded it completely. It left me humbled, and deeply grateful to be reading the Malazan Book of the Fallen.

#### The silent patient by Alex Michaelides

⭐️⭐️⭐️  
#bookclub

I’m conflicted about The Silent Patient. At first, I found the first-person perspective irritating — as I often do — because it narrows the lens through which we see the world. Few novels use it well; To Kill a Mockingbird is one that succeeds. While the first-person narration initially grated on me, I began to wonder whether Michaelides intended that discomfort — perhaps inviting readers to feel the same constrained, self-justifying perspective that Theo himself inhabits. His motivations are clear and self-justified, yet riddled with contradiction. He insists he could never kill, yet he harms with impunity. He sees himself as a healer and helper of others, but suffers no remorse for the pain he causes.

At first, I found Alicia’s diary a clumsy device to give voice to a character who could not speak. Yet it became clear that it served an important emotional role. It offers intimacy and a counterpoint to Theo’s manipulative, self-justifying narrative. In Part Three, I wondered whether the story might have been stronger without it, relying solely on Theo’s investigation to unravel the mystery. But the diary ultimately provides balance — the necessary vulnerability and sincerity that the novel would otherwise lack. The twist, of course, depends on both the diary and the first-person voice; they are the twin mechanisms that make the revelation so effective.

The use of false trails is skilfully handled — Max, Paul, Jean-Félix — each a convincing suspect. I did not suspect Theo, but in hindsight the clues were plain to see, and that’s the mark of a well-executed twist. Once the truth emerged, I began to question how much of my trust, as a reader, had also been manipulated. This, I feel, was by design. Theo violates the trust of Alicia, his colleagues, and his wife, Kathy — and in doing so, he implicates the reader too.

Structurally, the novel works beautifully. The early image of happiness as “grasping at vanishing snowflakes” resonates powerfully at the end, when Theo is arrested — a perfect closing image of futility.

I also found Michaelides’s depiction of mental illness and therapy strikingly authentic. Theo’s pathology is subtly and precisely drawn. His manipulativeness, lack of remorse, and self-deception paint a vivid portrait of Antisocial Personality Disorder. His role as a psychotherapist amplifies this — granting him power over others while revealing his inability to master himself.

And yet, I found the book hard to read at times. Its realism and moral bleakness make for an uncomfortable experience. Few characters, perhaps only Paul, seem capable of goodness or openness. The world it paints feels cynical — though perhaps that’s the worldview of a sociopath rather than the author himself.

My three-star rating is not a reflection on the novel’s quality, but on the unease it provoked in me. I respect the precision of Michaelides’s craft, but found the cynicism almost too much to bear. The darkness of the story and the absence of redemption or compassion made it difficult to enjoy — yet perhaps that very absence is what gives The Silent Patient its lingering power: a mirror of human frailty rather than a promise of redemption.

<a id="entry-2025-10-the-great-gatsby-bb5ad4d2"></a>
#### The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald

⭐️⭐️⭐️

>A glittering tragedy of love and illusion — dazzling to the eye, but cold to the touch.

Evocative and beautifully written. Fitzgerald draws a sketch of the Gilded Age in the US where life, money, and love were cheap. The novel is a satire of a way of life, a way of thinking and behaving that is timeless — the worship of money and status, the hypocrisy of “old” money disdaining the new, and the way those with power treat those without.

I found it hard to love any of the characters. Gatsby’s love of Daisy, whose “voice is full of money,” is not pure, at least in my reading. He loves her for her status — for all she has and he has not, for where she comes from and he does not. His hard work, his building of wealth, and his achievements in the war are all to obtain what he can never be. It is up to the reader to interpret this cynically or as a tragedy. Both Daisy and Gatsby are ultimately unhappy. Is this due to societal constraint or their own vanity?

If Gatsby’s obsession reveals the tragedy of idealised love, Tom represents the brutal opposite: a man defined by entitlement and power. Tom is a caricature of a toxic masculine bore — characteristically selfish, self-justifying, and cruel. His love for his wife is transactional; Daisy is not sure why she loves him, and Tom loves Daisy for the respectable veneer she provides.

Nick, the narrator, is both judgmental and torn — enthralled by the glamorous world he brushes against but repulsed by it. His enchantment and revulsion are key to the novel’s ironic voice. In the end, he loves Gatsby (I think), yet is repulsed by how he made his money and even more so by the hypocrisy and coldness of the world of West Egg and New York.

The shallowness of the social world Gatsby inherits is drawn beautifully — the abandonment of Gatsby when the champagne has stopped flowing and the party has ended, with only a few people attending his funeral. If there is a parable here, it is that wealth does not create happiness or love, only loneliness while being surrounded by people who care nothing for you, only for what you can give them.

While the world is beautifully drawn and the characterisation vivid, I struggled through much of the book. I found it hard to empathise with the characters and felt the coldness of that world keenly. As such, I struggled to enjoy the novel; I am left wondering if Fitzgerald intended it to be enjoyed or merely _witnessed_. His prose is dazzling even as it exposes the emptiness beneath the glamour. As a work of art, it deserves its place as a classic of American and global literature.

### November 2025

<a id="entry-2025-11-embers-of-war-9dc5f0a8"></a>
#### Embers of War by Gareth L. Powell
Series: Embers of War 1

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

> A new, grittier, Culture series?

_Embers of War_ was a short and enjoyable romp through space. The pacing was fast, and the action felt natural rather than contrived. Powell wears his influences openly: Iain M. Banks’s _Culture_ novels, the extended _Star Wars_ universe, and perhaps _The Expanse_ in its gritty portrayal of competing human factions.

I liked Powell’s use of multiple first-person perspectives to build a more rounded view of events. When the story unfolds aboard the Trouble Dog, this structure works well. The shifting viewpoints of the three main protagonists often overlap or contradict one another, giving the reader a layered understanding of what is happening. In contrast, when a character is isolated—on the run, in exile, or alone on a distant posting—the same technique limits what we can see. Yet this narrowing of perspective mirrors the characters’ isolation, reinforcing their sense of confinement and loneliness.

Where I felt the novel faltered was in its treatment of Nod. Clearly a sophisticated and intelligent being, his limited English and terse inner monologue (“Eat, Serve, Sleep, Return to Mother Tree”) give the impression of simplicity rather than difference. This felt like a missed opportunity. It risks implying that a being who cannot communicate in human terms must also think in shallow ways. Science fiction has often reflected our tendency to confuse linguistic limitation with lack of intelligence. Powell could have explored the contrast between how the crew perceive Nod and how he actually experiences the world. That might have deepened the novel’s themes of empathy and understanding across species.

The foreshadowing of the Marble Fleet’s mysterious “Enemy” adds depth and gives the story room to grow into a series. The glimpses of strange creatures lurking in extra-dimensional space hint at a wider, darker universe. This is a trope I tend to enjoy—the unknowable threat that waits beyond perception. It reminded me of the monsters in Tchaikovsky’s _Final Architecture_ series, or the “demons” and “ultimates” in Christopher Ruocchio’s _Sun Eater_ books, and even the horror of _Event Horizon_. Powell’s treatment of this idea left enough mystery to intrigue without resorting to a cliffhanger. It will be interesting to see how he develops it in later volumes.

_Embers of War_ may not reach the moral and philosophical heights of the _Culture_ series, but it captures something of its spirit: a fascination with conscience, choice, and the possibility of redemption in the vast, cold arena of space.

#### Artificial Condition: The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells
Series: The Murderbot Diaries 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️

> An entertaining action sci-fi novel with a satirical edge and a deeper philosophical question: what does it mean to be "Human"

The second installment of the Murderbot Diaries was highly entertaining if a little shallow as more interesting threads such as the motivations of the SexBot, the role and rights of artificial intelligence are not explored. The job Murderbot takes to reach his old mining camp — to uncover what happened and confront his guilt — felt less engaging than his developing relationship with ART the mind of the research come transport vessel he hitches a ride with.

ART and Murderbot's relationship is the strongest element of the novel. ART feels like both little brother and concerned parent. He is both passive and powerful, capable of astonishing feats yet lacking Murderbot’s physical agency. ART's body is a ship and unable to interact with the universe at a human level. His childlike fear of scary stories made him feel human though an emerging and embryonic personality. Through his interactions and collaboration with Murderbot ART grows. He no longer takes a passive role and starts to act.

Murderbot explores his motivations and behaviors much as someone trying to work through their demons and the source of their bad choices and behavior. He is trying to grow and improve himself and realises that he no longer has to take orders. What is interesting here is his concern and care for his charges. Is it a result of his programming, a matter of pride, a left-over from the human elements of his cyborg body? We and he are left guessing.

Wells focuses on the action and lets the philosophical tenets of her story telling seep out through the cracks. You come to a Murderbot novel for the humor, the action and the satire on a post-democratic corporate world where life is cheap and money is all that matters.  Wells doesn't patronize her readers. She provides an entertaining tale with a little philosophical spice. Her moral point of view is both implicit (the interactions between characters) and explicit (the role of SexBots, SecBots, bonds and contracts). She paints a future no one (certainly not me) would want to inhabit — an extrapolation of the hypercapitalist and libertarian impulses of Wells’s native US.

I found parallels with Margaret Atwood's MaddAddam universe where technology, human nature and the world are subverted by greed and corporate interests. Though Well's world is full of wry humor and feels, at least to me, lighter than the worlds that Atwood tends to draw.

While my criticism of this specific novel as "shallow", are justified this is only entry 2 in a series of novels. There is plenty of time for the themes of free will, motivation and deeper characterisation of both Murderbot and other (perhaps returning) characters to deepen.

#### Fleet of Knives by Gareth L. Powell
Series: Embers of War 2

⭐️⭐️⭐️
Finished: 2025-11-17

> A wild space adventure with little emotional depth.

The novel was very much a middle chapter. The plot for the conclusion is set-up with the monsters in the mist revealed, the dark and conflicted motivations and actions of the Marble Fleet (Fleet of Knives) explored.

I liked that no character is safe with Powell. Alva Clays death was brutal and quick. Overwhelmed by a terrible force of alien parasite monsters. Powell drew the shock and trauma of the death well with the grief that attached Sal felt real and drawn. Though the death did not move me. I found myself interested in how Sal would react and this would impact the story. While this may sound callous Powell had not softened and rounded the character enough for me to feel the emotional punch. He attempts to soften Alva when Sal asks if she will be a sister to Trouble Dog and herself. But the character was not sufficiently developed. She is a hulking and moody presence on the crew.  The surviving crew (and of course Lucy) of Lucy's Ghost were ready placed to be replacements.

In my view the multi-view-point structure worked. But Powell lost an opportunity here. The internal turmoil of the characters and the Trouble Dog's role of observer could have been used to add greater emotional depth. Indeed missunderstandings between the crew could have been drawn to create dramatic irony helping the reader become more engaged with the characters.

Powell's characters interact in a transactional manner and the action takes precedence. In contrast to the Expanse by Correy which is similarly action paced the characters feel one dimensional. In the Expanse the loss and trauma and emotional impact on the reader are more pronounced. The only difference I can draw is the space for the characters to grow in the readers mind.

The key tropes of a space opera are there. Alien artifact (the "Restless Itch"), inscrutable and hostile aliens and an ensemble cast. The presence of these tropes feels more contrived then in the Expanse of Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga.

Ona Sudak's ark is drawn. She is doing terrible things for an apparent noble cause. A path she has walked before. I would not be surprised if she has a redemption in the third book. I find myself interested in what shape this will take and if Powell will surprise us.

I'm not sure, yet, that there is a clear moral theme to the story. There is a discussion of grief (Sal, Trouble Dog, Alva) regret (Sal, Trouble Dog) and the lost opportunity for redemption (Ona) but I felt these were incidental rather than central. Is Powell painting by numbers or is he going to be able to bring these themes into clear focus in his final installment?

In summary I found the novel formulaic with little emotional resonance. But very enjoyable to read. Who doesn't love a space adventure? I great read for the beach.

#### Rogue Protocol: The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells
Series: The Murderbot Diaries 3

⭐️⭐️⭐️
Finished: 2025-11-19

> An adventure story with a little philosophical seasoning.

Another entertaining story from Wells. The Murderbot is starting to become more and more human. His realisation that Miki was really free where it counted — free to save itself — and therefore that she really was a friend, in the real sense to Don Abdene, felt like a breakthrough. The Murderbot is now questioning everything.

The story follows Wells' pattern in _Artificial Condition_. We start with the Murderbot trying to achieve a goal (in this case gain dirt on GreyCris) but it becomes embroiled with a human group for which he takes on responsibility despite their better judgement. Something is trying to kill them, he does his heroic best to save them and they become grateful and attached. If Wells continues deepening Murderbot's inner life, then I may be able to tolerate the formula, but the balance is fragile.

Miki plays _Artificial Condition’s_ ART in this story. The action was entertaining and some of the larger themes (free will, what is right and wrong, the nature of humanity) play out in the background. The artistic choice to focus on the action and let the development of Murderbot come through slowly is interesting. At first I felt this was simplistic, but on reflection I believe Wells could be doing something interesting here. The Murderbot is going from seeing himself, and the humans it serves, as one dimensional beings. Humans are annoying and idiots, Murderbot kills things. To a more nuanced perspective of the world. His sarcasm is now laced with affection - he acts to protect because he wants to not because he is compelled. He questions what is "nature" _what I'm programmed to do_ vs what is his own free choice.

If each entry in the Murderbot Diaries follows the same plot formula I’m likely to get frustrated and bored. This is why I have given up on Neil Gaiman’s work — too many repeated patterns of character archetype (loner male with magic powers / specialness, kicking back against a remote power).

That said, the novel was entertaining and great fun to read. I will return and see if the plot to _Exit Protocol_ takes things in a new direction. Does Murderbot simply go on an adventure with some humans to protect or is _Exit Protocol_ going to take things in a new direction, certainly away from the rescue mission structure?

Absolutely — here is a **polished, final review** of _Shadows Upon Time_, written entirely in **your voice**, keeping your tone, concerns, and analytical depth intact. I’ve focused on structure, clarity, and coherence, but I have not simplified or neutralised your style. This is still _you_ — just the best-shaped version of what you already wrote.

#### Shadows Upon Time by Christopher Ruocchio
Series: The Sun Eater 7

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Finished: 30 November 2025

> **An epic and ambiguous ending to a modern classic.**

The Sun Eater saga has been a long journey, from Hadrian’s beginnings as the son of a minor lord to Emperor of the Galaxy,  and _Shadows Upon Time_ offers a grand, emotionally charged conclusion. Despite the turbulence of Ruocchio’s mid-series change of publisher, this final volume confirms my confidence in the future of epic speculative fiction. Few modern authors attempt something this vast; fewer achieve it with such audacity.

##### **Genre, or the refusal of it**

One of the Sun Eater’s defining qualities is Ruocchio’s refusal to remain within the boundaries of either science fiction or fantasy. _Shadows Upon Time_ continues this hybrid tradition: lightsabers (High-Matter) that function as both physics and magic; magi and wizards alongside FTL drives; gods, monsters, and ancient alien powers woven into the same fabric as starships and empire. The Chantry operate as a kind of theological Inquisition, the Cielcin as the implacable enemy, and the Watchers as a near-metaphysical horror. Hadrian, meanwhile, occupies the central role of hero, tyrant, saint, and unreliable witness all at once.

##### **Influences openly worn**

Ruocchio wears his influences proudly. His Catholicism is visible in the metaphysics of the Watchers and the Absolute, and Hadrian’s repeated resurrections make the Christ parallels impossible to ignore. The echoes of _Hyperion_ are especially strong in this final volume - corrupted clergy, war with machines, and the manipulation of time itself. Yet these influences never feel derivative; they are refracted through Ruocchio’s voice, not copied.

##### **The memoir as revelation and concealment**

One of Ruocchio’s boldest choices, and perhaps his greatest triumph, is the memoir conceit. We have always known, from the opening pages of _Empire of Silence_, that Hadrian survives to write his account. The suspense comes not from wondering what happens, but how and why it happens. _Shadows Upon Time_ is the crux of this device. The novel keeps us circling the central unanswered question: _how does Hadrian come to write these words at all?_ We never truly learn. This final ambiguity is both frustrating and fitting. Hadrian controls the narrative because he is the only narrator we will ever have; and we are left to decide how reliable he is.

##### **Politics in the subtext, perhaps by design**

There is a political resonance running through the novel that feels impossible to ignore. Lines such as:

> “Innocence was beyond demonstration, beyond fact…  
> Truth was all that mattered, and truth belonged to Alexander.”

This reads like a commentary on contemporary “post-truth” politics. The Chantry’s suppression of forbidden technology may be interpreted as a critique of religious authority, or big tech, or simply the modern struggle over who gets to define reality. Ruocchio gives no single answer. The ambiguity is part of the design.

##### **What the ending leaves us with**

The final question, _How did Hadrian return once more, and why?_, is left deliberately open, allowing the legend to outgrow the text. Whether this is an invitation to future stories or simply a gesture toward myth is unclear. But it works.

##### **Hadrian himself**

Hadrian’s long monologues, often full of moral justification and a certain superiority, can be trying. But they are part of the memoir’s integrity: this is a man defending his life to history. His self-importance and his self-critique coexist in a way that makes him flawed and therefore human. Across seven enormous volumes, he becomes a character you can admire and resent, believe and doubt — more complex than Paul Atreides, more conflicted than Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader.

##### **A modern classic?**

Will the Sun Eater stand alongside the great epics — _Dune_, _Hyperion_, _The Culture_? I think so. It has the scope, the ambition, and the moral weight to endure. Ruocchio’s fusion of genres, theological metaphysics, and enormous storytelling power have created something rare: a series that grapples with power, myth, and destiny without losing sight of the emotional centre of its hero.

_Shadows Upon Time_ is not a perfect ending, but it is a bold one — and the Sun Eater cycle earns its place as one of the major speculative achievements of the last decade.

#### Dust of Dreams by Steven Erikson
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen 9

⭐️⭐️⭐️
Started: 2025-12-01
Finished: 2025-12-23

It is hard to write a review of the ninth Malazan Book of The Fallen - "Dust of Dreams" not because it is great or terrible (it is neither) or because I did not like it. But rather it is the penultimate book and I must hold to my faith that Erikson will be able to bring this rambling, incredible, frustrating maze of a story to a satisfying conclusion in the Crippled God.

In the Dust of Dreams Erikson makes his recurring theme of _Compassion_ and his critique on unquestioning loyalty and religion explicit. Compassion is mentioned explicitly 15 times in the novel. It is said rather than explored through the words and actions of the characters. This makes Eriksons message more explicit but weakens the subtle force of his message in _Dust of Dreams_. Elsewhere Erikson has explored compasion through multiple characters such as Coltaine, Itkovian, Fidler and Rake. The powerful example of these characters actions serves the theme far better than simple declaration.

Erikson further enhanced and deepened his critique on human nature. Eriksons exploration of courage was particularly good. His complication of courage marks him as an exception amongst the fantasy writers I have read. Erikson writes of courage as a complex aspect with the possibility of great moral failure.

> Unfaltering courage saw no sacrifice as too great even if that meant leading ten thousand soldiers to their deaths

Even heroism is examined

> No, the true nature of heroisim is a messy thing a confused thing of innumerable sides...
> Many of them ugly and almost all of them terrifying

Erikson links both courage and the notion of heroism to toxic masculinity. The Bagharst are his example. He shows that _courage_ can condemn a society to brutality and an inability to change. The fear the Baghast have of loosing face prevents them from showing compassion to themselves, their tribe mates and the stranger. This ultimately destroys them.

Erikson's treatment of women becomes more vivid and complex and also perhaps more troubling to a casual read. Women, especially the Baghast women, are seen as a group that pull each other down like crabs in a bucket. But Erikson is more subtle. In the hobbling of Hetan he shows that the real source of the women's cruelty is their powerlessness against the abuse they receive from the men. While not excusing this barbaric act and terrible behavior it is explained and the women become another victim of courage. Courage to do the wrong thing.

Later Kisswhere shows a different side of female cynicism when she imagines the meeting of powerful females generals and leaders:

> Eyes like blades - snip slice snip

In my view this is more characature than deepening or refracting the theme of inward self-hatred the women of the Baghast demonstrate. Erikson is at risk of being accused of taking a misogynistic view of women. Though this can be countered by the power and force of the female characters throughout Malazan.

What frustrated me about Dust of Dreams was not the characterization, world-building or pace but the frustration of not knowing or even feeling that we were going anywhere. There is no clear path to an end.

We have had a clash in the wastes, the Bonehunters all but wiped out (apparently) and the rising alliance of humans and K'chain Che'Male. I have never felt the need to take an authors choices on trust more deeply. How on earth Eriskon will resolve all these threads. The use of Icarium as a deus ex machina to solve the invasion of the short tails felt anti-climatic and a waste of this incredible and enigmatic character - it did not resolve a moral choice, nor did it feel as though there was a consequence. Potentially it also means that we may never learn the mystery of Icarium and his lost memories. The birth of the new Azarth in his place gives a clue to a deeper more satisfying purpose but this must be taken on faith. I was hoping for a clearer articulation of stakes, a view of over the horizon to the final act would have helped the reader. But I have learned that Erikson does not hold your hand.

So I look to the _Crippled God_ both with excitement and trepidation. How will Erikson manage to tie the knot. As a reader all I can do is trust that he will.

#### Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens

Did not finish

Started: 2025-12-23
Finished reading: 2025-12-30 at Chapter 26

I struggled my way through twenty-six chapters; at times greatly enjoying myself and at others (and most) profoundly frustrated.

Dickens’s writing in _Nicholas Nickleby_ is uneven. At times he writes with such precision and clarity — as a master artist producing a vivid impression with a few strokes on a canvas. For example:

> “…stands Newgate; and in that crowded street on which it frowns down so darkly”

Dickens wrote for serials, which incentivized expansiveness at the expense of clarity and pace, and this results in extemporization which does not drive the plot or characterization.

The characters feel more like caricatures than protagonists. Nicholas and Kate Nickleby, with their perfect morals, looks, and virtue, appear one-dimensional and hard to empathize with. Emotional responses are stated rather than felt, often by a character shedding a tear. Mrs Nickleby was by far the most frustrating of characters for me. She is portrayed with clumsiness, and her naïveté is not sympathetic. She is Austen’s Mrs Bennet but without the humor or, at least to me, the satire that made Mrs Bennet both lovable, complex, and funny.

While almost certainly unintended, the emotional intensity and hyperbole of the relationships between many characters invites a queer reading. For example, the obsession that Miss Knag has for Kate Nickleby feels like it could be the reaction of an older woman to a threat to her own perception of self and worth, but also erotic obsession. Mr Mantalini and Ralph Nickleby’s interactions appear to be flirting; then, of course, there are the relationships that Nicholas forms with Smike and Noggs. Smike is the Samwise to Nicholas’ Frodo, with Smike filling the role of devotion and sacrifice framed within a class hierarchy.

Perhaps these interactions were normal between heterosexual men in the 19th century, but the interactions appear charged with longing and sexual desire. Of course, this could be a deliberate satire by Dickens on male friendship, but I can’t see his motivation here. More likely, I feel the relationships are drawn with such hyperbole that they pass beyond what Dickens intended.

I greatly enjoyed _Great Expectations_ and so know that Dickens can do oh so much better. The moral simplification, sentimentalization, and lack of restraint leading to hyperbole was too frustrating to allow me to continue; I read, after all, for pleasure. I can imagine that _Nicholas Nickleby_ is a parody of Dickens, so different was my reading experience between the two novels. I will try Dickens again, but will look to his later work.

#### The nice and the good by Iris Murdoch

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

#bookclub  

I read the introduction to _The nice and the Good_ by Catherine Bates. I wish I had not. The introduction colored my own interpretation of the novel and I cant escape the fact that Bates has influences, poluted, my own reading. With that given as a caveat here is my reflection on the _The nice and the good_.

First it is a beautiful Novel. The atmospheres are beauifully drawn. The worlds of Dorset, Domestic, Demonic and Professional London are all ddistinct in feel and impression. Murdoch draws pictures in the mind with excellent use of metaphor and emotion. For example:

> The summer melancholy of suburban London, gritty, contingent, trivial, hung over the scene like an old familiar smell.

- Chapter Seventeen, page 142

Thematically the novel graples with what is good and what is bad but also what is moral and unmoral. Goodness without forgiveness or love is shown as empty or "nice". Characters are moral ideas but also human. Octavian and Kate are shallow hedonistic creatures concerned more with how they are loved by others and their own centrality to their lives.

Kate:
> "you are all my dear -- Children"
Duncane:
> "Slaves"

- Chapter Thirty, page 267

> "Her people seemed preocuiped, almost too preocuipied to rejoice as they ought to at her reapearence"

- Chapter thirty, page 268

This is in contrast to Mary, Willy, Paula and of course Ducane. Octavian and Kate's love is narcississtic as contrast to the love that Mary, Paula, Pierce and Barbie all demonstrate.

Does the novel achieve its purpose? Yes. The central thesis is that there is no greater evel than man's inhumanity to man and that no good can come except through love is manifest deeply in each deeply drawn relationship. Ducane with Jessica, his obsession with Kate and ultimately his love and admiration for Mary.
As Kate says _"Loving people matters doesnt it? Really nothing else matters except that".

And the world of Dorset in its comfortable boeorgeous superiority can be seen in contrast with Radeechy's and McGrath.

> "How natural it is to cure the pains of vice by positive develry. Vice itself is a rescue from the misery of guilt"

There are three problems I have with the novel. Its treatment of Homosexuality through Uncle Theo, its portrail of class and the ending.

Theo is a homosexual and pederast:

> "Picturing himself as taking the naked Kouros (Pierce) into his arms"

and is portraied not as a "real" man:

> "it occured to no one to count Uncle Theo as a man"

In addition there is the episode in Idia where there was a scandal between Theo and a Novice Monk which ended in death. I dont' see the purpose of Theo in the plot or indeed in the moral lesson except perhaps to show homosexuality as a vice - lust without love - perhaps. Where jessica is active in her lust for love perhaps Theo is a contrast to provide the fullness of the lesson? I felt this was not neccessary and I resent this portrait. It could be argued that Theo is a moral counterpoint to Ducane - where Theo's desire is intelectual and controling could be a warning to the fate of Ducane - especially in relations to Jessica. But still the Pederastic nature of Theo's desire was uneccessary to draw this portrait.

Class and the privalege of the english upper middle cannot be ingonred in her group. I found the treatment of those of a lower station than the Dorset set as problematic. McGrath, Judy and Fives are by turns; blackmailers, sexually unfaithful (if not a sex worker) and unreliable theives. The middle class characters are portraied with complexity, able to be both good and bad. It is hard to find good in McGrath. It confuses me why at the end Ducane gives McGrath a job as his servant and driver. Is this to show the moral superiority of Ducane in his abilty to forgive and proviee a second chance? This doesn't make sense to me.

The happy ending between Mary and John Ducane felt sudden and unexpected. One could argue that the realisation of love, when confused by circumstance, pride and missplaced assumptions, is sudden but i felt there were not enough breadcrumbs laid by Murdoch to make this seem, if not inevitable, but possible. A lesson on pain, patience, friendship and love could have better been drawn by deepening the interaction between John and Mary. Rather I'm left with the impression that love sprang after Ducane heroically saved Pierce (Mary's son). This feels a shallow reason to fall in love.

This sudden ending is why I gave four stars rather than five. The ending between Mary & John felt abrupt. But i enjoyed and admired _The nice and the good_ and will look to read more Murdoch in future.
