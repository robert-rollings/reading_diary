#### The Crippled God by Steven Erikson

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Series: Malazan Book of the Fallen #10
**Started:** 2026-01-05  
**Finished:** 2026-01-15  

The conclusion to such an epic work defies a review that is succinct. The first—and most important—question I have to ask is: _Did Erikson deserve the trust I placed in him upon finishing_ **Dust of Dreams**? The answer is yes.  

In many ways, _The Crippled God_ is the archetypal _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ novel: a plot filled with symbolism, complex motivations, and clashing perspectives—rarely explained to the reader. The novel can be read on three levels:  

1. A fast-paced fantasy novel filled with the classic tropes (excellently done) of **Gods**, **Monsters**, **Good vs. Evil**, **Magic**, and **Dragons**—epic battles and tragic sacrifice.  
2. A beautifully crafted world of vast and intricately drawn landscapes, cultures, peoples, and characters.  
3. A treatise in moral philosophy that weighs what is God, what is love, and what either means without compassion.  

On 1 and 2, Erikson completely succeeds. The action, world, and characters are beautifully drawn, and the pace frantic. We are drawn with the **Bonehunters** across the desert, feeling their thirst and desperation. We feel their world and their pain, and the action is viscerally rendered with all the gore, violence, and horror of war. The withholding of **Tavore’s** inner life until the final chapters continues to work excellently as a storytelling technique. She is the canvas for others’ projections and becomes the vehicle through which we come to understand the motivations and beliefs of others. This is particularly striking and poignant.  

On 3, Erikson almost—but not completely—succeeds. _The Crippled God_ and the attempt to right the injustices piled upon Him form a great and noble cause. Yet I’m left with unease: is the pain and suffering of one being—no matter how great—worth the death and torture of thousands? Is Erikson suggesting that the little people should be sacrificed for their betters?  

A utilitarian argument is not the only way to critique Erikson’s moral message. He plays with the “Great Men” theory of history, with **Tavore**, **Shadowthrone**, and **Cotillion** as the “Great Men.” But what of the little people used as pawns to right this wrong? You could extend this to a Marxist criticism: the proletariat—the **Bonehunters** and others—are sacrificed by the bourgeois (**Tavore**) for the nobility (**The Crippled God**, etc.).  

There is, however, a counterbalance. The Gods are shown as greedy, selfish, and venal—but also as the creations of a fallen humanity. It is humanity’s task to right the wrongs as best they can. Justice depends on good people doing the right thing for the right reasons. **Tavore** and the **Bonehunters** are the ones who decide to act, and through them, Erikson reasserts faith in the power of compassion and agency.  

Even with these moral tensions unresolved, the ambition and coherence of Erikson’s vision remain extraordinary.  

As a piece of literature and a great story, the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ is a masterpiece. It is fantasy, and it is literary fiction. In scope, scale, and structure, it can be compared to another great work of literature—Dante’s _Divine Comedy_: an epic work of morality, with **Gods**, **Monsters**, and **Angels**; the just and the unjust. The themes of redemption, faith, and love are comparable.  

One final note: the poetry at the beginning of parts and chapters didn’t really work for me. This may well be a personal failing. I’m not comfortable with poetry and find it hard to appreciate, though I recognize it as part of Erikson’s attempt to give the saga a mythic and elegiac tone.

#### The Light of Impossible Stars by Gareth L. Powell

⭐️⭐️⭐️

The concluding chapter in Powell’s space opera is competent and engaging with good world building and excellent pace. Short sharp chapters and shifting perspectives, but to my mind, unexceptional. In this final instalment, Powell crystallises the themes of individuality and moral choice: it is the actions and choices that make a person—human or otherwise. Organisations that seek to strip away that agency are suspect. As one passage puts it:

“I had seen firsthand what happened when men and women surrender their individuality to the state, when they allowed themselves to become pawns in someone else's games.”

Powell delivers a broadly consistent moral message, but its force is weakened by the character of Cordelia Pa. Subsumed into the mind of the Plates, she at first chooses to fight, only to later concede—to flee, to do what she was built for. This contrasts with Troubledog, who explicitly chooses not to do what she was built for. Is it therefore acceptable to surrender individuality for a good cause, but a moral imperative to reclaim it against a bad one? If so, what is truly at stake is not individuality itself, but the definition of good and bad. The architecture of the argument falters there.

I also had structural issues with The Light of Impossible Stars. Powell’s shifting perspectives, which I have enjoyed in earlier books, feel inconsistent here—slipping between first and third person. Some characters’ voices are distinct; others blur. Sal and Troubledog’s characterisation stood out as the strongest.

Finally, the deus ex machina of Cordelia Powell felt unnecessary. It created an overly neat ending, allowing Powell to tie up the story too easily, without much compromise. I was left feeling there were many unexplored possibilities—sabotage, persuasion, alliance-building with other races. The tidy resolution seemed like a missed opportunity.

Overall, an enjoyable but unchallenging read. It didn’t teach me much or leave a lasting aftertaste—perfect, perhaps, for a holiday, but not one that will linger long in memory.

#### I, Claudius by Robert Graves

Series: Claudius 1

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This is a work of profound scholarship and ambition and ultimately art. I believe _I, Claudius_ is an inspiration for other authors of historical fiction I have read (Hilary Mantel & James Clavels) who share his intimate style and focus on motivations and inner lives of their characters. I strongly believe that Christopher Ruocchio was influenced by Graves. His Empire is modeled on ancient Rome and we see that world of intrigue war and violence through Hadrian's narration of his own autobiography.

I'm left wondering if "Claudius" is a reliable narrator and if Graves meant him to be perceived as such. Graves paints Claudius as a virtuous man according to the norms of a patrician of his time. But even by the standards of the early-mid 20th Century (when Graves was writing) Claudius is a monster. He keeps slaves, is indifferent to his own children, and delights in the suffering of Gladiators and animals at the games.

It is hard for any modern historian or author to separate myth, propoganda and fact. I believe that Graves relies heavily on "The Life of the Ceasars" by Suetonius. I have not read this but understand it to be, with Tacitus, one of the only near contemporaneous sources.

The style is dense with facts, names and dates thrown at one constantly. Though Graves mostly succeeds in maintaining pace and intrigue. I will certainly read _Claudius the God_. I'm hoping we see more hypocrisy and self justification from Graves' Claudius and we see a little more of the internal life of the Paletine hill and palace.

This novel has been extremely successful, attracting praise from celebrities and broadsheet newspapers such as The Guardian and The Times. It is firmly situated in the realm of popular literary fiction: accessible, reassuring, and undemanding. It asks very little of its reader, and its ambitions are correspondingly modest. The moral is universal, the metaphors are clichéd, and the prose lacks subtlety:

> …she was. A black hole. A dying star collapsing in on itself.
> The world’s smallest violin playing.

The plot follows a familiar structure, repeating both the moral logic and narrative shape of It’s a Wonderful Life, with Mrs Elm occupying the role of the guiding angel. An unhappy person attempts suicide and is granted the opportunity to glimpse alternative lives in order to learn the value of the one she has abandoned.

> “Happy moments can turn into pain given time.”

These lives, however, are conspicuously without jeopardy. The early episodes — in Australia, in the Cotswolds pub, in Svalbard — function as illustrative sketches rather than genuine explorations of choice and consequence. They teach Nora very little, and they ask even less of the reader. It is only when she arrives at her life with Ash that the novel gestures towards emotional weight, yet even here the execution feels thin. Her love for her daughter is incidental and superficially rendered; I did not feel the wrench or depth such a relationship demands. The relationship with Ash is similarly hurried, sketched just deeply enough to serve the moral before the narrative moves on.

Despite this, the novel is effective. On finishing it, I found myself making a renewed vow not to take my life for granted. But this effectiveness comes easily. The sentiment is so broad, the moral so universal, that eliciting an emotional response feels like the minimum achievement rather than a mark of distinction. I felt the message, but I was not inspired by it.

A truly great novel would have forced me to confront my own regrets and choices, not merely reassured me of the value of life in the abstract. The Midnight Library offers comfort rather than confrontation, affirmation rather than disturbance. I am not convinced that this is a failure so much as an intention: to unsettle the reader too deeply might compromise the novel’s commercial appeal. As it stands, this is a perfectly pleasant beach read — soothing, sincere, and emotionally legible — but not much more.

#### Blindsight by Peter Watts

⭐️⭐️

This is a novel filled with ideas. the nature of sentience, cociousness and free will. The question asked _is sentience really all that great - is it an advantage or a drawback - can an inteligent being be unaware?_  These themes are compelling and are subtly worked in from the begining with Siri's awareness of his world irreparably changed by his radical hemispherectomy at as a child.

There are three _"aliens"_ in Blindsight. First there is Siri. His role as _"Synthesist"_ means he is always on the edge of the groups he works with, an outsider by neccessity. He is an alien by human standards having to use algoirthms and patterns to navigate through the human social world as a Chineese Box. He interprets the world without any understanding of it, just as he interprets the augmented humans he is sent to observe and explain. Second is Jukka, the Vampire, who is feared as much as he is needed. Jukka is the alien in the midst of the Theseus. Too different to be accepted by Siri or the crew of savants.

Then of course there is the Rorschach and the scamblers. They have inscrutable motives, just as Jukka and Siri, are deadly (as Jukka is) and live in a strange and alien world to the crew (just as Siri does). The question implied by Watts is if the Rorschach and the scamblers are any more alien than humans are given circumstances and perspective. The only characters who really understand what is happening are Jukka and the scramplers (with Siri at the end) - the concious human savants are blind.

I found Watt's style full of sharp edges. The continual use of specialist terminiology had me reaching for the dictionary constantly and then Wikipedia when the OED failed me. This broke my flow and took me out of Watts' world. I can't help but be left with a problem with the Watts' style over the substance of his writting. The sentences felt "stuttery" and lacking in eligence. I haven't got the knowledge and critical skill to pin point the source of this frustration - but I felt this as I read. This did not fit with the character of Siri. He is supposed to be able to explain ideas and produce reports that are easily understood by the elite of his world. Surely then he should be a better writter? The plot jerked along with flashbacks into Siri's past littered throughout. While providing welcome background and character development they did not fit with the narrative conciet that Watts has chosen. Why would Siri include this in his account? What difference would this make to his audience at home - how do they strengthen his warning to the people of Earth? A change in tactics here could have integrated this far better into the story. Jukka could taunt him with his past as he surely had read everything there is to know of his crew. Instead Watts chose the immediacy of a physical assault at the expense of the novels own internal coherence.

A novel then with great ambition stumbling in the execution. I'm not put off by Watts, his ideas make the effort of grappling with his prose worth while but I don't believe he will feature often on my bookshelves.
